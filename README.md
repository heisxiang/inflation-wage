BLS Inflation and Wages Project

Remember when when milk was 1 dollar a bottle? Remember when it cost 1 dollar to watch a movie? Remember when you could buy a new car for 1 dollar? Ah, the good ole days. How many of us have heard friends/family/ourselves complain about how everything has grown except their salary?

Is this really true? Are prices really increasing more than our salaries? Is our purchasing power really decreasing, or is it just an illusion? What does the data say?
